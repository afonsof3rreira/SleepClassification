This is a project for the classification of sleep stages from multi-modal Polysomnogram (PSG) recordings. This project was part of the [PDSB](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/mebiom/disciplina-curricular/1529008500343) course of the 1st year/2nd semester of the [Master in Biomedical Engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/mebiom) at [Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). The final minipaper can be found on the [LaSEEB's website](https://wiki.laseeb.org/attachments/download/137/G6%20Sleep%20Stage%20Classification.pdf).
